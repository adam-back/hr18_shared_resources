//Given an object, Feline:
var Feline = function(name) {
	this.paws = 4;
	this.mammal = true;
	this.name = name;
}

/*create two subclasses, Cat and Lion, which inherit Feline's three properties

Lion should have two new properties: "subsistence", set to "wildlife", and "mane",
set to "true" (yes, I know only male lions have mains, but just go with it).
It should also have its own method, 'sound', which console logs 'roar'.

Cat should have two new properties: "subsistence", set to "kibble"
and "temperment", set to "snarky". It should also have its own method, 'sound', which 
console logs 'meow'.

Remember, your constructor methods should still work.

Pseudoclassical style!
